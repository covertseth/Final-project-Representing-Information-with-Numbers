# How to Represent Information with Numbers and Binary Tutorial
## By: Seth Covert
In this tutorial we wil be going over **Binary** which we all can agree is a pain to learn but are all aware of it's importance because it's the foundation of Computer Science and Information Technology it's how the computers process information and communicate. Binary is always reviewed in a lot of classes over the first week or 2 proving the importance but didn't have it stuck in my head always haveing to refresh myslef overthe concepts.

This tutorial will be great for people similar to me who loves this major but hates numbers and conversion and thought this stuff was all suppose to be left in math class. This tutorial is similar to coding for idiots book because i'll have every steps/shortcuts broken down with their explained purpose. Students will be using this to guide them through the complicated conversions of decimal number to binary.
