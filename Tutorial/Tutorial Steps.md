# Learning how to Represent Information with Numbers!
## Assignment Questions:
Question 1) An ASCII encoded message represented by the the following decimal numbers. **084 104 101 032 100 105 103 105 116 097 108 032 119 111 114 108 100 032 105 115 032 099 111 111 108 033**

Question 2) Convert the following sentance using ASCII to a sequnce of decimal values.

**Use bits to communicate.**

Question 3) Convert the decimal value **147** to binary.

Question 4) Convert the binary value **01011011** to decimal.

## Question 1
- Take a deep breath and look at how you only got **4** question and only need to use/change **4** numbers, easy.

- So you know its an **ASCII message**, providing us with a group of **Decimal Numbers**. There are plenty of ASCII links and tables trying to get your attention, just looking over these are will help a lot and is why Prof Dales provides so many links to it in his documents. The ASCII table is a blessing and great to bookmark and have it easy to find. Don't let the 084 or 032 numbers get you, YES they are the same as 84 and 32 on ASCII table, the computer will always have 3 numbers when representing decimal numbers. So craft and build the sentance like normal left to right, each number set after the other. This question should be solved quickly because the link allows you to input your decimal number in the table and provides you with it's conversions into Hexadecimal, Binary, HTML, and then into it's character value too(084 is a `capital T`).

## Question 2
- This question slightly overlays the past steps taken for quetion 1, but in reverse so you have to seach the character and discover the 3 numbers that represent them(**ex:** `capital U` is 085 and 117 is a `lowercase u`).

- Don't forget to look up the sneaky period too.

## Question 3
- Converting a decimal is cake considering you only need to find the value of just 1 set of decimal numbers. Although the table is nice it's important to know the math behind decimal number to binary. After the decimal number 127 the ASCII table ends and you must view the Extended ASCII table to get the answer and the extended table goes from 127 - 255.

- Decimals -> Binary is super easy, first write the decimal number, divide it by 2. If the number being divided is an oddnumber subtract it by 1 and set the number 1 to the side. Keep dividing it by 2 until you cant anymore. Easy way to think about it is that the odd numbers being broken down are just the 1's in binary version because you can't go into decimals during conversion, and if the number is even those are the 0's. and write the binary number from left -> right until you can't divide anymore.

## QUESTION 4
- This should be the only question that may take a second because of all the time's you'll probably be recounting the 1's and 0's to double check.
- Binary -> Decimal is the easiest conversion. Don't over complicate the easiest task. everytime you see a binary numbers all it really is across the board is 1^1 1^2 1^4 1^8 1^16 1^32 and etc. **Don't read that and expect it's the right direction.** In binary it goes left -> right from 1^32 -> 1^16 down. You need to see the decimal number from the big picture and see if ex: decimal number 69 goes into 64? yes that's good and it now has a remainder of 5, that matches up with 1^4 and 1^1 making 69 = 1000101 in binary.
